# Our Design Language

## Color Palette
- **Background Color:** A soft, light greyish-blue (`#E5ECED`) is used as the primary background color, giving the interface a clean and calm appearance.
- **Primary Color:** A light cyan (`#8DDBE0`) is used as the primary accent color, contributing to a fresh and modern aesthetic.
- **Secondary Color:** A muted teal (`#9bc4bc`) is used as a secondary color, complementing the primary color while maintaining the calm, soft look.

## Typography
- The interface uses a mix of sans-serif fonts, specifically `Poppins`, `Verdana`, and `Arial`. This combination ensures readability and a contemporary feel.

## Layout & Spacing
- The body has generous margins (`20%` on both sides), likely designed for a centered, focused content area with ample whitespace.
- The avatar image is positioned in the top-right corner, implying a user-centric design that keeps user actions and personalization easily accessible.

## Buttons
- Buttons are styled with subtle padding and rounded corners, creating a soft and approachable appearance.
- The buttons have a slight drop shadow and a hover effect that increases the scale and shadow intensity, adding a touch of interactivity and depth to the UI.

## Visual Hierarchy
- The clean background and consistent use of soft colors help maintain a clear visual hierarchy, allowing key elements like buttons and text to stand out.
- Icons are simple and monochrome, aligning with the minimalist and user-friendly approach.

## Overall Design Language
- The design language emphasizes a modern, clean, and user-friendly interface with a focus on calm, soothing colors and simple, intuitive interactions. The overall aesthetic is minimalistic, prioritizing clarity and ease of use.
