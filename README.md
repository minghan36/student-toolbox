## Connecting to the database

We use a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) cluster to store user data:

1. Contact a team member to get the connection string.
2. Add the connection string to your `.env.local` as `MONGODB_URI=<connection string>`.
3. Modify the `User` schema in `/lib/mongodb/mongodb.js` to specify the data types you want to store.
4. Use the [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) API to push changes to the database.
5. Install [mongosh](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/) (CLI) or [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) (GUI) to inspect database contents.

## Authentication

We use [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) to provide authentication and session management:

1. Contact a team member to get the authentication secret
2. Add the secret to your `.env.local` as `AUTH_SECRET=<secret>`.
3. To register a new user, navigate to `/register` and enter a username and password.
